  This file is a terrible hack.


  The `dotnet-try.*.nupkg` package is never rebuilt to have a stable version because that's handled manually.  The fix
  is to not allow it to be picked up by the repack targets by temporarily renaming it before the
  `PackageReleasePackages` target and restoring it's name after.

  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetTryPackages Include="$(ArtifactsShippingPackagesDir)\dotnet-try.*.nupkg" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <!-- Appends the extension `.renamed` to the dotnet-try package to force the glob `*.nupkg` to not pick it up. -->
  <Target Name="RenameDotNetTryOutputPackage" BeforeTargets="PackageReleasePackages">
    <Move SourceFiles="%(DotNetTryPackages.FullPath)" DestinationFiles="%(DotNetTryPackages.FullPath).renamed" />
  </Target>

  <!-- Removes the `.renamed` extension from the dotnet-try package. -->
  <Target Name="RestoreDotNetTryOutputPackage" AfterTargets="PackageReleasePackages">
    <Move SourceFiles="%(DotNetTryPackages.FullPath).renamed" DestinationFiles="%(DotNetTryPackages.FullPath)" />
  </Target>
