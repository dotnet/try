// This class exists because F# can't open static classes like it can modules.  All items on the `FSharpPocketViewTags`
// module below are essentially fields that are initialized at runtime start, which means that there is only one
// instance of the `div` item.  Since calling the indexer to set attributes or the `innerHTML()` method to set the
// content mutates the inner value, we need a way to get around that.  The fix is for this class to exist at the root
// level, but as soon as a mutating method is called, a clone is made.  The base type is kept the same to simplify the
// public API surface area.
