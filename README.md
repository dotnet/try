## Basics
**What is Try .NET**: Try .NET is an interactive documentation generator for .NET Core.

**Please Note**: At the moment Try .NET only works with C# documentation. 

**What is the repo for?**
- A place where you can post issues about [Try .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/try/issues).
- **Note:** The code for Try .NET is not currently hosted on GitHub.*(Coming soon)*

## Experiences 
 Use Try .NET to create executable C# snippets for your websites or,  interactive markdown files that users can run on their machine. 

**Websites** 

Microsoft Docs uses Try .NET to create interactive documentation. Users can run and edit code in the browser.

**Interactive .NET documentation**

Try .NET enables .NET developers to create interactive markdown files.
To make your markdown files interactive, you will need the [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0), the dotnet try global tool(*coming soon*) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) / [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)(or any other editor of your choice).

## Setup
Before you get can start creating interactive documentation, you will need to install the following: 
- [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
- [dotnet try global tool](*coming soon*)
Once you have successfully installed `dotnet try` global tool, enter the command `dotnet try -h` you will see a list of commands:

| Command        | Purpose                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `demo`         | Learn how to create Try .NET content with an interactive demo |
| `verify`       | Verify Markdown files in the target directory and its children.            |
## Getting Started

You can get started using either one of the options below. 

**Option1**: `dotnet try demo` 
- Create a new folder.
- `cd` to your new folder.
- Run command `dotnet try demo` 

**Option 2**: Starting from scratch.
1. Go to the terminal and create a folder called `mydoc`.
2. `cd` to the `mydoc` folder and create a new console app with the following command
 ```console
    > dotnet new console -o myApp
```
This will create a console app with the files `myApp.csproj` and `Program.cs`.

3. Open `mydoc`folder in Visual Studio Code. 

4. Create a file called `doc.md`. Inside that file, add some text and a code fence:

````markdown
# My Interactive Document:

```cs --source-file ./myApp/Program.cs --project ./myApp/myApp.csproj
```
````
5. Now, navigate back to the `mydoc` folder and run the following command:
```console
     > dotnet try
```
You have created your first C# interactive developer experience. You should now be able to run your console app and see the result in the browser. 

**Option 3**: Explore our [samples folders](Samples). 
- Read our quick [setup guide](Samples/Setup.md).
