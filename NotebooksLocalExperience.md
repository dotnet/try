# Create .NET Jupyter Notebooks

## Installing the .NET kernel for Jupyter 

First, make sure you have the following installed:

- The [.NET 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **Jupyter**. Jupyter can be installed using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution).

- Open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS) and verify that Jupyter is installed and present on the path:

```console
> jupyter kernelspec list
  python3        ~\jupyter\kernels\python3
```

- Next, in an ordinary console, install the `dotnet interactive` global tool:

```console
> dotnet tool install -g dotnet-interactive
```

- Install the .NET kernel by running the following within your Anaconda Prompt:

```console
> dotnet interactive jupyter install
[InstallKernelSpec] Installed kernelspec .net-csharp in ~\jupyter\kernels\.net-csharp
.NET kernel installation succeeded

[InstallKernelSpec] Installed kernelspec .net-fsharp in ~\jupyter\kernels\.net-fsharp
.NET kernel installation succeeded
```
    
- You can verify the installation by running the following again in the Anaconda Prompt:

```console
> jupyter kernelspec list
  .net-csharp    ~\jupyter\kernels\.net-csharp
  .net-fsharp    ~\jupyter\kernels\.net-fsharp
  python3        ~\jupyter\kernels\python3
```

## Using Jupyter with .NET

To launch JupyterLab, you can either type `jupyter lab` in the Anaconda Prompt or launch a notebook using the Anaconda Navigator.

Once Jupyter Lab has launched in your browser, you have the option to create a notebook for C# or F#.

Once the notebook opens, you can start working with .NET in the language you chose.

For more information on the .NET notebook experience, please check out our samples and documentation on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dotnet/try/master?urlpath=lab).

 Once you've created a .NET notebook, you might want to share it with others. In the [next document](CreateBinder.md), you will learn how to share your .NET notebook with others using binder.
